# Clareif
In line with the new guidelines on Clareif, we need a online form where people can submit their opt-in/opt-out choices. 

Uses a Ninja-form behind a Raven log-in where people can choose whether they are opting-in to Clareifornication and whether they are opting-out of Clareification, which would then update a database that the Clareif editors can access. 

The ninja-forms_clareif plugin deletes old submissions by the user, so there is only one user submitted entry in the database at one time.
